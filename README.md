- bio:text

*Has Many Books*

### Book

- name:string

- isbn:integer

- publication_date:date

- description:text

- author_id:integer

## API Endpoints

All responses will be in JSON format.

The base url format for all endpoints is:

```
http://localhost:8000/api
```

| Method      | URL         | Description  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| GET     | **/authors** | get all the authors and all the books associated with all the authors |
| GET | **/authors/:id** | get an author by id and also get all the books associated with that author |
| POST | **/authors** | create a new author (name:string, bio:text) |
| PUT | **/authors** | update a new author (name:string, bio:text) |
| DELETE | **/authors** | delete author by passing given id field. Also deletes all books associated with that author |
| GET | **/books** | get all the books |
| GET | **/books/:id** | get a single book by passing id to params |
| POST | **/books** | create a new book (name:string, isbn:integer, publication_date:date, description:text, author_id:integer)|
| DELETE | **/books** | delete a book by passing id to params |

## Getting started

First clone the repo and change directories into it.

Workflow is run `webpack` to build out client side and `node index` or `npm start` to fire up the server. The app will run on **localhost:8000**

The webpack command will compile the javascripts and Vue templates into bundle.js that is in turn called by index.html. The next command will start the server and server index.html to the browser.

[christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate](https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate) is a good example of a more advanced and integrated webpack-express build system #todo

## Sequelize Notes

Below are some helper commands to get started and work around Sequelize and SQL databases with Javascript.

Define a model and migration in one command with [Sequelize CLI](https://github.com/sequelize/cli):

```
$ sequelize model:create --name=Author --attributes name:string,bio:text --underscored
```

Run migrations (creates tables): 

```
$ sequelize db:migrate
```

For seeding the initial database with Authors and Books, we use [sequelize-fixtures](https://github.com/domasx2/sequelize-fixtures).

## MySQL helper commands

Log in to MySQL with password:

```
$ mysql -u root -p
```
**Note to self:** login creds are root/root for local machine

Reset the password if it needs updating:

```
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'myNewPassword'
```

Create new user and give them all privileges:

```
mysql> CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```

Create a MySQL database:

```
CREATE DATABASE bookmarks;
```

Winning formula for database connection is: 
```
new Sequelize('database_name', 'database_user', 'database_password', config);
```
